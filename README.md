# picture-to-ascii-art

convert picture to ascii art : print result inside terminal or save in png file. Possibility to merge the original picture with the ascii art picture with differents effects.

This program was wrotten just for fun in order to send a "funny" picture to a friend. This is a base, so it could have some bug on your computer. Take it and improve it if you want, i think this program is useless but just "funny" (so I won't spend more time even if it could be improved to be more graphical, or to check if your terminal is 256 colors or not (I hope so !) or add other parameters).

easy to use :
- provide a path from the original picture you want to transform.
- choose text if you want to print in terminal or save in a text file.
- select image if you want a "png" file.
- modify the scale if you want (is usefull to print in terminal).
- select the policy size between 6 and 12 points.
- if RGBA file provide an alpha canal value (0 for maxi transparency, 255 for no transparency.
- select background color (avalaible on terminal also).
- save the output file without forget to write the extension.

if you want to merge the result with the original picture :
- select a pourcentage for width diffusion (the transition between the ascii art picture on left and the original picture on right).
- choose an angle in degrees in interval (-180;180) for the transition effect.
- choose the coordonate for the origine of the effect (0,0 representing the first top left).
- save the output file
